              In 2015 we are trying a spectacular new location north of Auckland; Shakespear Lodge is located within the beautiful Shakespear Regional Park.
              The Regional Park is a pest free sanctuary surrounded by a predator-proof fence and is home to several species of native lizards as well as many native bird species which have migrated from nearby Tiritiri Matanga island, itself a wildlife sanctuary.
            </p>

            <p>
              Be at Auckland Airport by 16:00 on the 30<sup>th</sup> of January if you want to catch the bus out to Shakespear Lodge. On the morning of February the 2<sup>nd</sup> we'll get you back to the airport before 2pm. Don't book your return flight before then!
            </p>

            <p>
              Due to generous sponsorship, tickets are $249 (or $149 for students and/or unwaged). They include accommodation, 3 meals a day &amp; snacks for the duration of the camp, a bus there and back from Auckland Airport, a supply of NZ craft beer and cider, soft drinks and espresso coffee.

              <li>Camping gear and vehicles should be checked before entering the sanctuary to ensure they are free of pests, vermin and hazardous material.</li>

            <p>
              Rails Camp is dedicated to providing a harassment-free camp experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>We do not tolerate harassment of Rails Camp participants in any form.</strong>
            </p>

            <p>
              Harassment includes but is not limited to:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion.</li>
              <li>sexual imagery.</li>
              <li>deliberate intimidation.</li>
              <li>stalking.</li>
              <li>unwanted following.</li>
              <li>harassing photography or recording.</li>
              <li>sustained disruption of talks or other events.</li>
              <li>inappropriate physical contact.</li>
              <li>unwelcome sexual attention.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Participants asked to stop any harassing behaviour are expected to comply immediately.
            </p>

            <p>
              Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate anywhere within the camp venue, including during talks or in supporting materials such as slides or handouts.
            </p>

            <p>
              Sponsors are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, sponsors should not use sexualised images or material, either in person or in handouts or other collateral. Sponsor staff and representatives (including volunteers) should not use sexualised clothing or costumes, or otherwise create a sexualised environment.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>
                If camp participants violate these rules, including engaging in harassing behaviour, the camp organisers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the camp with no refund. This may include a temporary or permanent ban from future Rails Camp events.
              </strong>
            </p>

            <p>
              If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of the organising committee immediately.  A camp organising team member can be identified by their red Rails Camp t-shirt.

              Rails Camp will be happy to provide escorts, help participants contact police, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the camp.

            <p>
              We expect participants to follow these rules at all camp venues, on the journey to and from the camp and at any related social activities.
