        <h3>Welcome</h3>
        <p>
          Welcome to Rails Camp NZ 5. We're super glad you made it.
        </p>

        <a name="help"></a>
        <h4>Getting Help</h4>
        <p>
          Firstly, there's a floor-plan of the camp in your lanyard - just slide the insert out and unfold it and you'll quickly be able to figure out where you are.  Also, every room should have a poster on the door, so you don't get lost.
        </p>
        <p>
          Secondly, if you're looking for help with something technical then look for someone in a blue Rails Camp t-shirt or lanyard - these people have volunteered to mentor others, so will welcome the chance to help you out.
        </p>
        <p>
          Lastly, if you're having trouble with something camp related then look for the folks in a red Rails Camp t-shirt or lanyard. These are the camp organisers, and if they don't know the answer then they'll be able to find someone who does.
        </p>

        <a name="schedule"></a>
        <h4>Schedule</h4>
        <p>
          Rails Camp is an unconference, so you're free to give a talk or facilitate a discussion about anything that you think will be of interest to your fellow campers.  We have a schedule online on <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/186juFtcBFJQ0847yXJst4kBUj3t3qJskpMYr53hTPYw/edit#gid=0">Google Drive</a>, however since the camp doesn't have internet access that's probably not super useful for you.  We'll periodically <a href="/schedule.html">mirror it here</a> for you, but it's not editable. Sorry.
        </p>

        <a name="rubynz"></a>
        <h4>RubyNZ</h4>
        <p>
          Rails Camp is proudly organised by <a href="http://www.ruby.org.nz/">RubyNZ</a> - an incorporated society formed at the last Rails Camp NZ at Mt Cheeseman in 2014 to further the interests of the Ruby community in New Zealand.
        </p>
        <p>
          During this year's camp we'll be holding the society's first Annual General Meeting.  If you'd like to be involved then please make sure that you are <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1XTXYHJzOaS8v1ngptKPGOBvSDcS8vFnQ7jRdJRLCqB8/viewform">signed up to be a member</a>.
        </p>
        <h5>Call for Nominations</h5>
        <p>The committee is made up of a President, Secretary, Treasurer, and four general members. It should be representative of the diversity and geographical spread of the Ruby community.</p>
        <p>We are now calling for nominations to be part of that committee.</p>
        <p>The inaugural committee was tasked with setting up the society. Over the next year we need committed, passionate people to drive it forward.</p>
        <p>If you can help the Ruby community in New Zealand to be vibrant, welcoming, and diverse, or if you know someone who can, we would love you to be part of the Ruby NZ committee.</p>
        <p>For a nomination to be valid, it must be proposed and seconded by members of Ruby NZ. You can nominate yourself or second your own nomination if you like, or two other people can nominate you.</p>
        <p>You can nominate yourself, or someone else, <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1IN5wi7qU03c3eM7NDf74szCAuwRme2plAgW1QciNkaM/viewform">here</a>.</p>
        <p>Once nominations are proposed and accepted, they will be displayed on <a href="http://www.ruby.org.nz/">the RubyNZ home page</a>.</p>
        <p>Nominations close at 2:30pm on Sunday 1st February 2015, two hours before the AGM.</p>
        <h5>Call for AGM items</h5>
        <p>At the moment, the AGM agenda looks like this:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>President's report</li>
          <li>Treasurer's report</li>
          <li>Approve the financials</li>
          <li>Next Rails Camp organisers/location</li>
          <li>Hand out nominations</li>
          <li>Voting for new committee</li>
          <li>Any other business</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If you w ould like to add any agenda items please email <a href="mailto:secretary@ruby.org.nz">secretary@ruby.org.nz</a>.</p>

        <a name="services"></a>
        <h3>Services</h3>

        <a name="network"></a>
        <h4>Network</h4>
        <p>
          The camp wifi is available for all participants to use, however it is not connected to the internet.  If you have your own 3G connection, you should be able to use both without issue - just set your 3G connection to higher priority than your wifi.  Talk to a mentor if you need help with getting it working.
        </p>
        <p>
          The wifi settings are as follows:
        </p>
        <table>
          <tr>
            <th>Network name (SSID)</th>
            <td>RCNZ</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <th>Encryption</th>
            <td>WPA/WPA2 Personal</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <th>Password</th>
            <td>RCNZ2015</td>
          </tr>
        </table>

        <a name="rubygems"></a>
        <h4>Rubygems</h4>
        <p>
          We have an up-to-date Rubygems mirror available for you to access at <a href="http://rubygems.rc/">rubygems.rc</a>. Note that this VM has 3G internet connectivity, and should auto-update every hour.
        </p>
        <h5>Bundler</h5>
        <p>
          When using bundler you usually have a line near the top of your <code>Gemfile</code> which says something like; <code>source "https://rubygems.org/"</code>.  Just change it to <code>source "http://rubygems.rc/"</code> for the duration of camp and change it back again when you leave.
        <h5>gem install</h5>
        <p>
          To enable our mirror for your system rubygems you need to switch your gem sources by running the following in your shell:
        </p>
        <pre class="panel">gem sources --remove https://rubygems.org/
gem sources --add    http://rubygems.rc/</pre>
        <p>
          To re-enable your original gem sources when you leave camp just run the same process in reverse:
        </p>
        <pre class="panel">gem sources --remove http://rubygems.rc/
gem sources --add    https://rubygems.org/</pre>

        <a name="gitlab"></a>
        <h4>GitLab</h4>
        <p>
          <a href="http://gitlab.org/">GitLab</a> is available at <a href="http://gitlab.rc/">gitlab.rc</a>. Create an account and get going.  The GitLab VM does have 3G internet access, so when creating your project you can select <em>import</em> and enter the URL of your repository on GitHub and it will import it.  Please don't import massive repos - as you'll use up all our data cap.  If you have a copy of the repo on your laptop then please push it up from there instead.
        </p>
        <h5>GitLab Remotes</h5>
        <p>
          Adding the GitLab remote to your existing repository couldn't be easier.  First you need to create your project on the GitLab server, then copy the repository URL to your clipboard.  Once you have done that you can add the remote to your project using <code>git remote --add gitlab *repository url*</code>.  Now you can replace the word <code>origin</code> with <code>gitlab</code> while executing your usual git commands such as <code>git push gitlab master</code> and <code>git fetch gitlab</code>.
        </p>
        <div data-alert class="alert-box warning">
          Don't forget to push your changes to <em>origin</em> when you get back from camp!
        </div>

        <a name="chat"></a>
        <h4>Chat</h4>
        <p>
          If you've been to camp before you'll have probably used <a href="https://github.com/rnielsen/twetter">Twetter</a> before.  You'll also probably know that it's riddled with XSS and other bugs, and quickly becomes unusable as people mess with it.
        </p>
        <p>
          This year we have installed <a href="http://www.kandanapp.com/">Kandan</a> - an open source HipChat clone at <a href="http://chat.rc/">chat.rc</a> for you to use.  It's a great way to hook up with others with similar interests as you without having to introduce yourself to everyone in person.
        </p>

        <a name="your-service-here"></a>
        <h4>Your service here</h4>
        <p>
          You're welcome to run your own network services on the Rails Camp wifi network.  If you want a static IP address and DNS entry then fork the <a href="http://gitlab.rc/nzruby/boxes">Boxes</a> repository and change the <code>DNSMasq/ethers</code> and <code>DNSMasq/hosts</code> files.  While you're at it you might want to modify this page (<code>www/www/index.html</code>) to include a link to your service.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once you're done open a merge request and one of the red shirts will merge and deploy it as soon as they can.
        </p>

        <a name="code-of-conduct"></a>
        <h3>Code of conduct</h3>
        <p>
          All attendees, speakers, sponsors and volunteers at our camp are required to agree with the following code of conduct.  Organisers will enforce this code throughout the event.
        </p>
        <p>
          We are expecting cooperation from all participants to help ensure a safe environment for everybody.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>tl;dr Don't be a jerk. If you are a jerk, you may be punished. If someone is being a jerk to you, or someone else, please let the camp team know.</em>
        </p>

        <h4>Need help?</h4>

        <p>
          Any member of the Camp team can assist you, however the designated Code of Conduct representatives are:

        <h4>The Code</h4>

        <p>
          Rails Camp is dedicated to providing a harassment-free camp experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>We do not tolerate harassment of Rails Camp participants in any form.</strong>
        </p>

        <p>
          Harassment includes but is not limited to:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion.</li>
          <li>sexual imagery.</li>
          <li>deliberate intimidation.</li>
          <li>stalking.</li>
          <li>unwanted following.</li>
          <li>harassing photography or recording.</li>
          <li>sustained disruption of talks or other events.</li>
          <li>inappropriate physical contact.</li>
          <li>unwelcome sexual attention.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Participants asked to stop any harassing behaviour are expected to comply immediately.
        </p>

        <p>
          Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate anywhere within the camp venue, including during talks or in supporting materials such as slides or handouts.
        </p>

        <p>
          Sponsors are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, sponsors should not use sexualised images or material, either in person or in handouts or other collateral. Sponsor staff and representatives (including volunteers) should not use sexualised clothing or costumes, or otherwise create a sexualised environment.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>
            If camp participants violate these rules, including engaging in harassing behaviour, the camp organisers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the camp with no refund. This may include a temporary or permanent ban from future Rails Camp events.
          </strong>
        </p>

        <p>
          If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of the organising committee immediately.  A camp organising team member can be identified by their red Rails Camp t-shirt.
        </p>

        <p>
          Rails Camp will be happy to provide escorts, help participants contact police, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the camp.
        </p>

        <p>
          We expect participants to follow these rules at all camp venues, on the journey to and from the camp and at any related social activities.
